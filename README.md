# Fusion 360 Printer Materials
3D-Printed Materials for Autodesk Fusion360 -- Printed PLA, PETG, ABS, PC (Polycarbonate), PolyMax PC

## Overview
Fusion 360 has support for simulation with custom materials. This is an Autodesk / Fusion 360 material library with material properties filled out for several commonly used 3D printing materials. The material properties are specifically for 3D printed parts rather than molded or another manufacturing technique.

The material data is from research using 3D-printed parts. Sources are listed in the library.

## Materials in this library :electron:
* Printed PLA Plastic
* Printed PETG Plastic
* Printed ABS Plastic
* Printed Polycarbonate PC Plastic
* Printed PolyMax PC Plastic

## Usage ⚙️
1. Download and extract this folder
2. In Fusion360, go to `MODIFY` -> `Manage Materials` -> `Folder / Wrench Symbol (bottom left)` -> `Open Existing Library`
3. Choose the file "FusionPrintingMaterials.adsklib"

## How to Help Out
Some of the data sources used for 3D-printed materials were incomplete, and some parameters needed to be estimated. You can greatly help me and others by correcting mistakes in current material properties, finding better sources on 3D printed material properties, and sharing this project with peers. 

If you do find an error or want to post something regarding this project, please use the `issues` tab!

If you have a modified version of the library you want to share, feel free to open a pull request.

Keep building awesome stuff! 🚀

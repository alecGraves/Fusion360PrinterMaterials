## Overview
Fusion 360 has support for simulation with custom materials. This is an Autodesk / Fusion 360 material library with material properties filled out for several commonly used 3D printing materials. The material properties are specifically for 3D printed parts rather than molded or another manufacturing technique.

The material data is from research using 3D-printed parts. Sources are listed in the library.
